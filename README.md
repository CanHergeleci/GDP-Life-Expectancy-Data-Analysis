## Project Description
<p> This project explores the relationship between a nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and the life expectancy of its citizens. The primary goal is to analyze data from six different countries: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, the United States, and Zimbabwe, over a 15-year period (2000-2015). By visualizing and examining trends, this analysis seeks to understand how economic output correlates with health outcomes.<p>


## Getting Started
<p> In order to download and locally run this project, follow the instructions below.<p>

<h4> Dependencies required: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Python 3.10 or later</p>
    <p>This can be downloaded via <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python's Website</a></p>
    <p>Ensure you find the correct version for your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)</p>
    <p>Once downloaded, follow the instructions to install Python on your machine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:</p>
    <p> This is the environment used to run the analysis. You can install it by running <code>pip install notebook</code> in your terminal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Required Libraries:</p>
    <p> In your terminal, run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:</p>
    <code>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4> Instructions to run the program: </h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download the project files to your local device</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch your machines terminal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files. Use cd to change directories. You can run ls (Mac/Linux) or dir (Windows) to list files and confirm youâ€™re in the right place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you are in the correct directory, launch Jupyter by running the command: <code>jupyter notebook</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your web browser will open a new tab. Click on <code>life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb</code> to open the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To see the outputs, you can run all the cells by clicking "Cell" > "Run All" in the top menu bar.</p>
  </li>
</ol>


## Usage
<p> Once you have the notebook open, you can review the analysis, which is broken down into sections. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The notebook begins with an <b>Introduction</b> and a set of <b>Research Questions</b> that guide the analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <b>Data Cleaning & Preparation</b> section shows how the initial datasets were processed and merged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b> section, you will find the visualizations (scatter plots, line graphs, and bar charts) used to explore the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key takeaways and conclusions are summarized in the <b>Insights & Findings</b> section at the end of the notebook.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can modify the code in any cell and re-run it to explore the data differently.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
